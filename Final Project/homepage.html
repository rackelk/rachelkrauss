    <div class="hello">
    <p> Hi! My name is Rachel Krauss and I'm a recent graduate from Indiana University with a Journalism major in PR and Advertising and Marketing and Business minors. I function at my highest level when Iâ€™m combining my advertising and marketing backgrounds in project-oriented positions. In 2014, I had the opportunity to intern at Shopular, in Silicon Valley. My experience there was phenomenal because I was able to work on projects in several aspects of the marketing field, including influencer marketing and social media copywriting. Working at Shopular heightened my interest in both company branding and targeted digital advertising. Last summer I was the Demand Generation intern at Zuora, where I was immersed into the world of marketing automation and lead generation. I quickly learned the ins and outs of Marketo by working on programs for content, email and nurture campaigns.</p>
